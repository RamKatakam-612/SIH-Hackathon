0,6,"Saaho is entertaining. It is a proper Bollywood Masala movie. We all know it is one of the highest-budget Bollywood movies of all time.Aug 15 2019, The Independence Day, was supposed to have 3 blockbuster movies released. Mission Mangal, Batla House and Saaho. However, Saaho postponed their release. The movie went on to be a blunder. Most of them didn't like it. They weren't even sure where it was leading too. There was too much of pace, action. The first half seemed to be perfectly set for a mind-boggling Action Crime movie. It didn't turn out to be so. The second half ruined everything. There were few surprises and Suspense at the end, which not only made no sense, also, were a little too much. Disappointed with the climax as well. Prabhas is a renowned and magnificent actor. His Hindi wasn't upto the mark. Some characters looked complex and confused.","Jan 30, 2022"
1,6,The base story is good. Audience are left in confusion in many scenes. Many Action sequences are illogical. Intermission and climax is good. Good acting by all actors. Boring songs. All villains are great.,"Sep 1, 2019"
2,4,"Looks like the story was inspired from Largo winch movie and director tried to make it more engaging with twists and turns but he failed miserably... there was no proper story , illogical, routine story , unwanted scences etc .. prabhas was good for some extent but remaining cast failed.. bad direction and worst screenplay .. lengthy and no soul in the film .. people were sleeping after interval ..","Sep 1, 2019"
3,1,"Saaho...! There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to start. There were so many times throughout the film where I wanted to laugh at how stupid everything was. That is how hilariously bad this movie is.I don't think there is any point trying to explain the storyline of this movie because it barely exists. The movie thinks it's so clever when it tries to wrap up everything at the end but without any logical sense, it comes across as painfully silly.There were so many things happening but nothing kept me invested or compelled throughout its 3 hour runtime. I really don't know what was going through writer-director Sujeeth's head because he failed to even get the basics right. The dialogues written were just cheesy one-liners that made me want to facepalm every time I heard one. The jokes were nowhere near funny. This movie itself is a giant joke.The writing is vastly incompetent. There barely was any character development from anyone. Shraddha Kapoor's character had some development but it wasn't enough for me to care about her. Prabhas's character unfolded literally at the end of the film but there was so much trash from the previous 2 hours 40 minutes that I just didn't care anymore. The only thought I had was to get up and leave. The gangsters portrayed didn't seem menacing at all because we don't learn much about them. Chunky Panday did feel threatening but he wasn't given anything to work with so he was just wasted.The acting was okay. No one really stood out to me since everyone was wasted potential. I thought the chemistry between Shraddha Kapoor and Prabhas was very unconvincing and dragged the film a lot.I kept on noticing how atrocious the editing was. To me, the background score was immensely obnoxious. This film takes itself so seriously and the loud score makes even more dramatic. The songs didn't do anything for the film's 'story' so in the end they were just unnecessary.Another thought that crossed my mind was ""Where did all of the money go?"". With a budget that high, you at least expect the film to look really good. The special effects are laughably bad. There is a scene involving a snake and the snake looks really fake. Parts of the action scenes seem very unbelievable because of the effects and how illogical they are. The scenery in the songs are nice to look at but they are irrelevant to the actual narrative.Saaho is one of the biggest disappointments of 2019. Pretty much everything in this movie is flawed. You ask for logic and don't get any of that. I just wish they wrote a better story with fleshed out characters so that we have something worth watching. Saaho is all style and no substance.","Aug 30, 2019"
4,2,"Dont believe all the 10 star ratings and reviews!
they are just fans, trying to average up the rating to something less embarrassing!
if the movie was atleast somewhat good, you would've seen 5-8 star ratings too. no there are only 1-3 star and 9-10 star ratings!!
lmao, most of the profiles that gave 10/10 are just 1 week old, they created extra new accounts just to rate 10! omg they're trying so hard to maintain average rating! lolWhat a boring movie!
unnecessary twists, unnecessary sets, unnecessary characters!
i was about to give 1, the final climax fight was ok, so im giving 2!","Sep 8, 2019"
5,,"I have seen several flop or below average films in my life but this movie tops it all. I wanted to get out of the theatre at several instances while watching this movie. Had lot of expectations after seeing the buzz this movie got. Even an average director/writer could have written and directed a film more better compared to this disaster. The actors were good but there was no purpose, drama or any point to the action scenes shown apart from way too many overly done Hero elevation scenes(I sincerely hope Telugu films get past this format). All in all, it's a headache and people should be paid to sit through this entire film. Director should quit, producers should learn their lesson and lead actors, please pick good scripts as the audience come to the theatre looking at you and your faces.","Aug 31, 2019"
6,6,"1) Prabhas Hindi sucks
2) Imaginary UnderWorld sucks
3) Chunkey Pandey is wasted as villain.
4) Songs don't do justice to Prabha's iconic image.The only two thing I found good about the experience of seeing Saaho is actions and cheap tickets for admission.","Aug 30, 2019"
7,2,"Watched it in Hindi, god why didn't they hire the guy who dubbed PRABHAS'S voice in Bahubali, also make a note Prabhas is terrible with his comic timing...
Songs with the most terrible lyrics ever heard and for acting only Neil Nitin Mukesh and Ananya Panday's father looked like into it, storyline was probably written by WWE's PG era writers, the 150 minutes of movie felt like long long time ðŸ˜´","Aug 30, 2019"
8,9,Good movie with action scenes but songs placement is irrelevant,"Aug 29, 2019"
9,6,"Bad:
Boring 1st half
Very slow and confusing 2nd half
Bad song placements/forced songs
No storyline
Weak screenplayGood:
Chunkey Pandey as a villain
Couple of good twists
Very good interval twist
Best bgm
Very very good climax scene - Seems like watching a hollywood movie","Aug 29, 2019"
10,1,"I just ran to the theater coz of the hype that was created of Prabhas due to Bahubali. Booked 400 rs recliner tkt, just to dose off in theater.I used to fall asleep and then fight with myself to keep my eyes open so as to get the return of my investment.God he cant speak even a single line in hindi. It seemed that he was drunk throughout the movie. Creators should have used bahubali sound artist for hindi dubbing.Movie was very confusing didn't know what was going on in the beginning, in one frame they r showing some gangsters doing their stuff other frame they r showing some other thief stealing money in India.Action sequences were good,but some basic stuffs were completely illogical,for example-no one in police Deptt. checks for a new officers identity for a month to know who he actually was.I m thinking, I should also become a fake wing commander and join airforce. Then I dont understand y will anyone,throw parachute bag and then jump without the bag,just to show how macho he is.All the gangsters have got nothing to do apart from gossiping with chunky pandey. U can just watch this on laptop where u can fast forward it to the action scenes,rest of the movie is too boring and lengthy.","Sep 4, 2019"
11,9,"SAAHO is a fantastic experience. Never seen action scenes on indian screen, perfect movie for prabhas. Screenplay is superb, BGM is mind blowing. Everyone did good in their respective roles. Go without any expectations and i am sure you will come out of movie with a great experience.Its an intelligent action thriller.....#Saaho","Aug 29, 2019"
12,6,"First I'll say it's Inspired/Copied by Largo Winch a French Movie. Then I'll start with Prabhas the lead actor, he is performance is Great as we know he tried hindi you can see his hard work in his performance. His real voice is good (with strong tough voice). Story revolves around the chair of Mafia of the cit.
Graphics are good but not great it reminds me of android game Modern Combact the Helicopter and the smoke, blast. With the power-pack action movie serves the decent watch to me. Seriously some action sequences are indigestible like if you capture a criminal then cops check them if they have any arms left in pocket then how cops left the mobile phone of criminal in his pocket ok let's leave this, second if you was shot by bullet in your shoulder then how you'll fight there are some scenes too but leave. People will say its a movies boss and in movie everything is OK. First half makes you excited for 2nd half and it was good too.
In theater everyone was talking about the length of the movie but its ok. Director tried to brief out everything clearly so its ok. Song makes movie long. I personally like 2nd half where it reveals every twist parts and if I'll talk about action scenes then I'll say it's taken from many Many other movies like MadMax, F&F and some. Overall its ok worth watch if you like Prabhas that's it. Bit Gripping, full of Action, twist and ya bit confusing too. People will give mix reviews so don't go with reviews go and watch its not like you should watch right wait when the ticket price drops then go. I'll give 6 stars just for story and Prabhas and villains.. Greats performances by all but only performances can't save the movie.
Watch if like action/Prabhas or South Movies. - itsbymayank Mayank Bharat Bhushan Louteriya. Saaho Reveiw Done.
Do like down the review. Thank you all.","Aug 31, 2019"

shradha kapoor plz leave acting yr Final words Worst movie of the year Never watch it yaar plzzz Have some mercy on urself","Aug 31, 2019"
15,1,The name should not be saaho but saho.....saho for 3 hrs.....Ram Gopal Verma ki Aag isse jyada achchi hai,"Aug 30, 2019"
16,6,Saaho's pioneering attempts in stunt sequences and graphics are praiseworthy. However the story misses to naturally engage the audience.,"Aug 3, 2021"
17,1,Really bad story and prabas and shradha aren't suitable for this movie and still surprise that this movie has this much only because of some people who doesn't know anything about how a good movie looks like,"Aug 30, 2019"
18,10,If you're the fan of action thrillers that you can watch them multiple times then this movie is gonna run you theatres 10 times or more.Basics;Action+Suspense+Love Story+ Amazing BGM+ Perfect VFX+ Songs+ Prabhas = Marvelous Saaho.Bonus;Shraddha Kapoor has given an extraordinary performance and improved a lot. She performed every shades perfectly. She's doing very well now.,"Aug 29, 2019"
19,7,Story feel was missing due to bad narrative and bad background music. As heard we see twists every 10 minutes and twists before intermission and climax are the best ones. VFX and stunts are never seen before even in Hollywood and are a must see. Mixing scenes is one of the biggest mistake which confuses often.,"Sep 7, 2019"
20,1,"Would rate it 0.. if i had the option...
The movie was such headache to watch.","Aug 30, 2019"
21,8,"This movie isn't favorable for Sentiment Movie Lovers, To be frank story must have to be Improvised, Action, Cinematography, VFX are excellent. Shraddha Kapoor disappoints with her pale acting, Prabhas acting is Extraordinary, Neil Nitin Mukesh acting is Good. Mandira Bedi is totally a Scrap. Overall it's a One-time watchable. Sujit must have to concentrate on story line and screenplay. Overall it's a visual treat for people","Aug 29, 2019"
